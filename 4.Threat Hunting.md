## Threat Hunting Definition

### 🕵️‍♂️ **What is Threat Hunting?**

**Threat Hunting** is a **proactive, human-driven approach** to cybersecurity. It involves actively searching through systems and network data to identify threats that may have bypassed automated security tools.

Rather than waiting for alerts or system compromises, threat hunters go on the offensive — seeking out signs of malicious activity **before** damage is done.


### 🕰️ **What is Dwell Time?**

- **Dwell time** refers to the **duration between the initial compromise of a system and the time the breach is detected**.
- This time often stretches over **several weeks or even months**, giving attackers plenty of time to move within the network undetected.


### ⚠️ **Why is Threat Hunting Important?**

- Traditional, reactive security methods are **no longer sufficient**.
- Threat Hunting provides a **strategic shift** from defense to offense — focusing on identifying threats early in the **cyber kill chain** (the stages of a cyber attack).
- The goal is to **reduce dwell time**, detect hidden threats early, and **prevent deeper infiltration**.

### 🔁 **The Threat Hunting Process Includes:**

1. **Identifying assets** that are valuable and likely targets.
2. **Studying attacker TTPs** (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) based on threat intelligence.
3. **Searching for artifacts** and anomalies that deviate from normal system behavior.
4. **Using threat intelligence** to support hypothesis creation, hunting strategies, and preventive actions.


### 🔑 **Key Elements of Effective Threat Hunting:**

- **Offensive, proactive mindset**: anticipating threats before they strike.
- **Empathy with attackers**: understanding their behavior and mindset.
- **Deep understanding of your environment**: including network topology, digital assets, and baseline behavior.
- **Use of advanced tools and high-fidelity data** to analyze and detect anomalies.
- **Combination of hypothesis-based and evidence-based investigations**:
  - Hypothesis-driven: based on attacker behavior and threat intel.
  - Reactive search: triggered by confirmed incidents or indicators of compromise.

### 💡 Summary:
Threat Hunting is more than just detection — it's about **thinking like the adversary**, proactively searching for threats, and **preventing attacks before they succeed**. As cyber threats evolve, so must our defense strategies — and threat hunting is at the forefront of that evolution.

# Threat Hunting Glossary

Within the domain of cybersecurity and threat hunting, several crucial terms and concepts play a pivotal role. Here's an enriched understanding of these:

### 🔹 **Adversary**
An **adversary** refers to any individual or group that targets your organization for various purposes such as:
- **Financial gain**
- **Insider information**
- **Intellectual property theft**

🧠 Adversaries can be categorized as:
- **Cyber criminals**
- **Hacktivists** (political or social motivations)
- **Insider threats**
- **State-sponsored attackers**

### 🔹 **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**
An **APT** refers to highly organized, persistent attacks, often backed by nation-states targeting:
- **High-value targets** like governments, healthcare, defense systems.

🔍 "Advanced" doesn't necessarily mean the attackers use the latest technologies, but rather that they have sophisticated strategic planning.  
🔍 "Persistent" refers to their prolonged efforts to achieve their objectives with substantial resources.

### 🔹 **TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)**
TTPs describe the **distinct behavior patterns** of an adversary:
- **Tactics**: The **why** behind the adversary’s actions (strategic goals).
- **Techniques**: The **how**—methods used to achieve their goals (e.g., phishing, exploiting vulnerabilities).
- **Procedures**: The **exact steps** or “recipe” used to execute a technique.

🧠 Analyzing TTPs helps build **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** and strengthens threat detection.

### 🔹 **Indicator**
An **indicator** is a **technical signal** that provides a **contextual understanding** of a potential attack. Examples include:
- Malicious IP addresses, file hashes, suspicious URLs, or domain names.

![alt text](image-24.png)

🔍 A technical indicator without context has limited value. Context allows for effective analysis and response.

### 🔹 **Threat**
A **threat** consists of three key elements:
- **Intent**: The **reason** behind the attack (e.g., espionage, financial gain).
- **Capability**: The **tools and resources** available to the attacker (e.g., malware, expertise).
- **Opportunity**: The **circumstances** that allow an attack to occur (e.g., vulnerabilities, weak credentials).
![alt text](image-25.png)

### 🔹 **Campaign**
A **campaign** refers to a collection of related attack events that share similar **TTPs** and are typically motivated by the same goals or objectives. These attacks require detailed analysis to uncover and address.

### 🔹 **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
**IOCs** are digital traces left by an adversary during or after an intrusion. These may include:
- File hashes, IP addresses, domain names, and malicious scripts.

🔍 Tracking IOCs is crucial for identifying and mitigating attacks early.

### 🔹 **Pyramid of Pain**
The **Pyramid of Pain** is a hierarchical model that categorizes the **difficulty of detecting indicators** and the **impact on adversaries**:
- **Low-level Indicators** (e.g., hashes, IPs) are easy to alter by attackers.
- **High-level Indicators** (e.g., TTPs) are hard to change and significantly disrupt attackers.

🔍 As you move up the Pyramid, the **cost to adversaries** increases.

![alt text](image-26.png)

### 🔹 **Hash Values**
A **hash value** is a **unique digital fingerprint** of a file, generated using algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256.  
🔍 Hashes can easily change if the file is modified, making them less reliable for detection over time.

### 🔹 **IP Addresses / Domain Names**
- **IP addresses** identify devices on a network and can be used to track attacks. However, attackers may use VPNs, proxies, or TOR to hide their true IP addresses.
- **Domain names** link to IP addresses but can be obfuscated by attackers using **Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs)** or dynamic DNS services to avoid detection.

### 🔹 **Network Artifacts / Host Artifacts**
- **Network artifacts**: Traces left in **network traffic logs**, **DNS requests**, or ** packet captures**. They are harder to modify without affecting the attack's success.
- **Host artifacts**: Residual traces on **compromised systems**, such as unusual **registry keys**, **processes**, or **file paths**. These can provide crucial insights into the attack.

🔍 Both are hard for attackers to alter without revealing their presence.

### 🔹 **Tools**
**Tools** are the **software or scripts** used by adversaries during attacks. This may include malware, exploits, and command and control (C2) frameworks.  
🔍 Identifying the tools used helps understand the capabilities and intent of the adversary.

### 🔹 **Diamond Model**
The **Diamond Model** is a conceptual framework for analyzing cyber intrusions, based on four components:

![alt text](image-27.png)

1. **Adversary**: The individual, group, or organization behind the attack.
2. **Capability**: The tools and techniques used by the adversary.
3. **Infrastructure**: The resources (servers, domains, IPs) used to support the attack.
4. **Victim**: The target of the attack.

🔍 This model emphasizes the **dynamic relationships** between these components, helping to create robust strategies for detection and mitigation.

### 🔹 **Comparing with Cyber Kill Chain**
The **Cyber Kill Chain** focuses on **stages of an attack** (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation), while the **Diamond Model** offers a **broader view** of the components and their interactions during an intrusion.  
Both models provide complementary insights for cybersecurity professionals.
