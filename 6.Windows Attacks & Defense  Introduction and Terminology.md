## 🖥️ **Machines Used to Perform Attacks**

You will **simulate a scenario** where an attacker has already gained **remote code execution** on a Windows 10 machine:

| Component              | Description                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **WS001 (Windows 10)** | The compromised machine. The current user is **Bob**, a regular Active Directory user with **no special privileges**. |
| **Kali Linux**         | The attacker's machine, used to launch various attacks.                                                               |

## 🧱 **Network Topology (Machines and IPs)**

| Machine        | IP Address             | Role                                                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DC1**        | `172.16.18.3`          | Domain Controller 1 (primary Active Directory controller)                         |
| **DC2**        | `172.16.18.4`          | Domain Controller 2 (secondary or load-balanced)                                  |
| **Server01**   | `172.16.18.10`         | Service server in the network (could host data, file shares, etc.)                |
| **PKI**        | `172.16.18.15`         | Public Key Infrastructure – certificate server (used in attacks like AD CS abuse) |
| **WS001**      | `172.16.18.25` or DHCP | Compromised user machine (Bob)                                                    |
| **Kali Linux** | `172.16.18.20` or DHCP | Attacker’s machine                                                                |

👉 Depending on the section, the IPs may be **static** or assigned via **DHCP**.

## ✅ Scenario Summary:

- The attacker has already **gained access** to a Windows machine inside the internal network (WS001 – user Bob).
- The goal is to perform **lateral movement**, **privilege escalation**, and more.
- You will use **Kali Linux** and **WS001** to practice these techniques in a simulated enterprise environment with Active Directory.

# Introduction and Terminology
## **What is Active Directory (AD)?** 📂

**Active Directory (AD)** is a **directory service** developed by Microsoft, officially released in 2000 with **Windows Server 2000**. Since then, Microsoft has continuously improved AD with each new server OS release. Based on the **X.500** and **LDAP** protocols, AD is a **distributed**, **hierarchical structure** that allows centralized management of an organization's resources.

#### **AD Manages** 🧑‍💻:

- **Users** 🧑‍💼  
- **Computers** 🖥️  
- **Groups** 👥  
- **Network Devices** 🌐  
- **File Shares** 📁  
- **Group Policies** 📜  
- **Trusts** 🔗

It provides essential functionalities such as:

- **Authentication** ✅
- **Authorization** 🔑
- **Accounting** 📊

AD ensures that administrators can manage permissions and control access to network resources across the organization.

### **Why is Active Directory Important?** 🔑

AD is widely used in enterprise environments, making it the **most common Identity and Access Management (IAM)** solution globally. **Most enterprise applications integrate seamlessly with AD**, making it a critical service for organizations.

#### **Impact of AD Compromise** ⚠️

A breach in AD could mean the compromise of **all systems, data, and applications** in the organization, violating the **CIA** (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) triad. This makes AD one of the most crucial components in any enterprise network. 

#### **Example of a Threat - Ransomware** 🦠

- Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in AD to deploy **ransomware**, which encrypts the organization's data and demands a ransom for decryption.
- Compromising AD is more dangerous than a single system breach because it affects the entire network.

### **AD Vulnerabilities and the Growing Threat** 🔓

- **Microsoft** has disclosed **over 9,000 vulnerabilities** in AD since 1999, with **3,000** discovered between 2020 and 2022.
- These vulnerabilities indicate **growing research** and attacks targeting AD, making it a prime target for cybercriminals.

### **How to Secure Active Directory?** 🛡️

#### **Patch Management** ⚙️

- **Patch management** is essential to keep AD secure. Proper patching prevents many exploits, but organizations still struggle with this.

#### **Other Security Measures** 🛠️

- **Defense in Depth** 🛡️: Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect the network.
- **Network Segmentation** 🔌: Isolate critical systems to minimize damage from a potential breach.

### **Further Learning** 📚

If you're new to AD, consider reviewing these resources:

- **Intro to Active Directory**: Learn the basic structure and functions of AD.
- **Active Directory – Enumeration and Attacks**: Deepen your knowledge of common attacks and defenses.


## 🔐 **Active Directory (AD) Refresher**

### 🌐 **1. Domain**
- A domain is a group of users, computers, and devices sharing the same **AD database**.
- **Example**: `test.local`  
🧑‍💻 + 💻 + 📂 = One Domain

### 🌳 **2. Tree**
- One or more **domains grouped in a hierarchical structure**.
- Share the same **namespace**.
- **Example**:  
  - `test.local`  
  - `staging.test.local`  
  - `preprod.test.local`  
📁 Tree = Domain + Subdomains

### 🌲 **3. Forest**
- A collection of multiple **trees**.
- The **topmost structure** in AD.  
🌍 Forest = All Domains + All Trees

### 🗂 **4. Organizational Unit (OU)**
- Containers inside a domain to organize users, computers, and groups.
- Helps with delegation and structure.  
🗃 OU = Logical folders in AD

### 🤝 **5. Trust**
- A relationship that **allows access to resources** across domains.
🔗 Domain A 🔁 Domain B


### 🖥 **6. Domain Controller (DC)**
- The **boss server** that manages the domain.
- Handles:
  - **Authentication** ✅  
  - **Authorization** 🔐

### 💾 **7. Active Directory Data Store**
- Where all the AD data lives.
- Most important file: `NTDS.DIT`
📍 Path: `%SystemRoot%\NTDS`

### 👤 **8. Regular AD User**
- Can still **enumerate** lots of AD data:
  - Domain Users 👥  
  - Domain Computers 💻  
  - Groups 📚  
  - GPOs ⚙  
  - Trusts 🔒

### 📡 **9. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**
- Used by systems to talk to AD.
- Runs on ports **389** (plaintext) and **636** (SSL).
🔍 LDAP = Speak AD’s language

### 🛡 **10. Authentication in Windows**
- Methods include:
  - Username & Password 🔑  
  - NetNTLMv1 / v2  
  - Kerberos 🎫  
  - Certificates 📜

### 🎫 **11. Kerberos & KDC**
- **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** lives on the DC.
- Issues **tickets**:
  - **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**  
  - **TGS (Ticket Granting Service)**  
- Uses **KRBTGT account** to generate encryption keys.

### 👑 **12. Privileged Groups**
- **Domain Admins** & **Administrators**: 🦸‍♂️ full access
- **Enterprise Admins**: top-level across all domains
- **Account Operators**: can reset passwords (⚠️ can be misused!)

### 💻 **13. Logon Types**
- Show how users log in:
  - Type 2: Interactive 🧑‍💻  
  - Type 3: Network 🌐  
  - Type 10: Remote via RDP 🖥
⚠️ Only Type 3 doesn’t leave password traces


### 🧰 **14. RSAT Tools (GUI for Admins)**
- **AD Users & Computers** 🧑‍💼👩‍💼  
- **Group Policy Management** 🛠  
These tools turn **LDAP queries into mouse clicks!**

### 🌐 **15. Important Windows Ports**
| Port | Service                |
|------|------------------------|
| 53   | DNS                    |
| 88   | Kerberos               |
| 135  | RPC / WMI              |
| 137-139 / 445 | SMB          |
| 389 / 636 | LDAP              | 
| 3389 | RDP                    | 
| 5985 / 5986 | WinRM (PowerShell) |



## 🌐 **Real-World View of Active Directory (AD)**

### **1. System Classification** 🗂️  
Every organization classifies systems based on their **importance to business operations**.  
Examples:  
- **ERP** 📊  
- **CRM** 🤝  
- **Backups** 💾  

🔐 In Active Directory, **additional roles/services** (like DNS, PKI, SCCM) must also be classified.  
Why? Because if these services are **compromised**, they can become **privilege escalation paths** into the **core of the AD forest**.

### **2. Privilege Escalation Paths** ⛓️  
- AD is complex and **feature-heavy**  
- Attackers who gain admin access to services like DNS or Configuration Manager can often **indirectly escalate to Domain Admin**

🛡️ These systems must be protected as carefully as **Domain Controllers**, as they can act as backdoors into the forest.

### **3. AD’s Built-in Weaknesses** ⚠️  
There are **three main categories** of weaknesses that increase the attack surface:

#### 🧩 a) Complexity: **Nested Groups**
- Users can be members of groups ➡️ inside other groups ➡️ and so on...  
- This makes it hard to track who has what permissions  
- In some environments, even a regular user can **indirectly be a Domain Admin**

🧠 Tip: Always check **group membership chains** when auditing access

#### 🏗️ b) Design Flaws: **GPO + SYSVOL + SMB**
- **GPOs** are stored in a shared folder: `\\DOMAIN\SYSVOL`
- Every domain-joined machine pulls policies from SYSVOL using **SMB (port 445)**
- If an attacker has **valid credentials**, they can:
  - Remotely access SYSVOL  
  - **Execute commands on Domain Controllers** over SMB

🚫 This violates **Zero Trust** principles and creates remote code execution risk.

#### 📻 c) Legacy Protocols: **NetBIOS + LLMNR**
- Enabled by default in Windows (for backward compatibility)
- These protocols **broadcast user credentials** over the network
- Even if DNS is working, they remain active  
- Attackers can use tools to capture these and **crack password hashes**

💥 One packet sniffing session = potential **domain compromise**

### ✅ Key Takeaways:
- 📌 **Classify** services based on impact and escalation potential
- 📌 Treat certain systems like **DNS/PKI** as high-value assets
- 📌 Watch out for **nested group escalation paths**
- 📌 Disable **legacy protocols** (NetBIOS, LLMNR)
- 📌 Monitor and restrict access to **SYSVOL and SMB**
